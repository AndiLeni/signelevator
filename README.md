# Sign Elevator

This mod provides sign based elevators for Minecraft.
The mod works fine in singleplayer and multiplayer. 
To make it work in multiplayer, the mod must be installed serverside.
An installation on the client is only necessary for singleplayer mode.

This mod was written to allow players with a vanilla client on a fabric server to use lifts without having to install a mod.
